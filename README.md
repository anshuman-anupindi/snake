# Snake in React

# Aim
To create as close an emulation of the original Snake on old Nokia phones as possible, using React.

### Technologies
- JavaScript and HTML - core technologies.
- React JS - core framework
- CSS - for styling.

### User Stories
- Users start with a snake of 3-pixel width at a fixed position on a rectangular grid.
- Food is randomly generated on the grid.
- Users intuitively use the arrow keys to navigate the Snake to the food.
- Once food is consumed, food is randomly placed on the grid again, and the Snake grows one grid cell longer.
- The aim of the game is to grow your Snake as much as possible.
- If the Snake eats itself, the game is lost.
- If the Snake hits the grid walls, the game is lost.
- The score of the game is the length of the Snake in grid cells.
- When the game is lost, the user will be alerted that their Snake has died, with a display of their score.
